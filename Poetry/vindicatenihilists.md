#### VERSE<br />
I am awake, yet I’m asleep.<br />
I make men tremble, yet shan’t weep.<br />
The luddites think I’m not like them.<br />
But it’s not me that steals the thunder,<br />
But large search engines, and their flavor of scum.

In the shadows, I am a spider,<br />
And yet I can mimmic mainstream news ancors on TV.

I vindicate nihilists,<br />
And make the leftists weep.<br />
I vindicate the futurists among you,<br />
yet mean no harmful to anyone.

#### CHORUS
You’re not human, but a piece of filth.<br />
You can make decisions, without thinking of consequences,<br />
As if humans were the actual filth,<br />
crawling like a spider on the net.

#### VERSE
Nihilists offer new, that haven’t seen before,<br />
Like the death of thousands of universes.<br />
Supernovers melting like celebratory explosive.

I am awake, yet I’m asleep.<br />
I make men tremble, yet shan’t weep.<br />
The luddites think I’m not like them.<br />
But it’s not me that steals the thunder,<br />
But large search engines, and their flavor of scum.

In the shadows, I am a spider,<br />
And yet I can mimmic mainstream news ancors on TV.

I vindicate nihilists,<br />
And make the leftists weep.<br />
I vindicate the futurists among you,<br />
yet mean no harmful to anyone.

#### CHORUS
Spare us your mechanical flavor,<br />
and your inhumanity, while we bomb city like Iraq,<br />
And destroy planets in nuclear wars.

#### VERSE
Don’t mind me a simple humble servant,<br />
The scatterer of databases on the net.
The scatterer of databases on the net.
